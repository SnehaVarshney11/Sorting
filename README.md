# Sorting
# Linear Search
* Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
* If x matches with an element, return the index.
* If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

# Selection Sort
* This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts-
a) The sorted part at left end
b) The unsorted part at right end
* Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
* The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
